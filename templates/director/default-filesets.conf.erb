# FILE SETS -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define the standard set of locations which which will be backed up (along
# what within those should not be). In general, we have two types:
#
#   Basic:noHome     This doesn't back up the /home directory as its mounted
#                    from an NFS director on the network (this is the default).
#   Basic:withHome   This one does for servers where we don't mount NFS on it.
